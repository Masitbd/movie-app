# Movie Galleri Project

### This is a sample demo netflix type application where users can select video and see the details video. Users can also see the related type of video


### Users can also see the list of videos that have already been viewed. I have retrieved the viewed video from session storage. I have also added pagination if more video in the database user can see by clicking next button.


### I have also used the json server and use your data. The application is not complete yet it needs some couple of days to complete. But you will get the basic idea of what I am trying to do. You will find the source code file from my github account.
